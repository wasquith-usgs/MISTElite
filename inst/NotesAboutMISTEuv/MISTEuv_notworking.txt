William,

Here you go, tried to make it as concise as possible

Description of problem: MISTE UV will not run for a  recent (Un-Approved) specified
period of time, keeps failing.  MISTE UV Log shows some column name and NaN problems,
like it can't parse the data correctly from NWISWEB.

If an older already approved period is selected using the same two sites MISTEUV runs
without a problem and gives a result.

Background: USGS hydro tech workflow is to work and screen their data in real time as
much as possible, this process involves flagging the discharge with various qualifiers
until such time as the data can be finalized, properly estimated if need be, peer
reviewed and set to Approved in AQ and in turn on NWISWEB.

These qualifiers tied to discharge before the record is Approved distort the amount
of data columns and position of the data columns that MISTE UV expects to be in a
fixed format.

Solution: Remove all AQ qualifiers tied to discharge on both sites, removing only
one sites qualifiers also yielded a failure with MISTE UV.
Thanks,
Matt N.
